"""
Class Method:
    A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance.

    class C(object):
        @classmethod
        def fun(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
           ....

    - They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class
       and not the object instance.
    - It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class.
    - We generally use class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects
      ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.

Static Method:
    A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.

    class C(object):
        @staticmethod
        def fun(arg1, arg2, ...):
            ...

    - A static method canâ€™t access or modify the class state.
    - A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
    - We generally use static methods to create utility functions.
