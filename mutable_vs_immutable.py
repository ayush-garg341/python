"""
All the data in a Python code is represented by objects or by relations between objects. 
Every object has an identity, a type, and a value.

Identity:- An object's identity never changes once it's been created. you may think of it as the object's address in memory. 
The "is" operator compares the identity of two objects; the id() function returns an integer representing its identity.

Type:- An object's type defines the possible values and operations (e.g. "does it have a length?") that type supports.

Value:- The value of some objects can change. Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable; 
objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable.

mutable :- list, dictionary, set and user-defined classes
immutable :- int, float, decimal, bool, string, tuple, and range

We can see that the list identity is not changed, while the tuple identity is changed.
