"""
Design a class to efficiently find the Kth largest element in a stream of numbers.
The class should have the following two things:
    1. The constructor of the class should accept an integer array containing initial numbers from the stream and an integer â€˜Kâ€™.
    2. The class should expose a function add(int num) which will store the given number and return the Kth largest number.
