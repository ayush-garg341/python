"""
Given an array, find the sum of all numbers between the K1â€™th and K2â€™th smallest elements of that array.

example1:
    Input: [1, 3, 12, 5, 15, 11], and K1=3, K2=6
    Output: 23
    Explanation: The 3rd smallest number is 5 and 6th smallest number 15. The sum of numbers coming
    between 5 and 15 is 23 (11+12).

example2:
    Input: [3, 5, 8, 7], and K1=1, K2=4
    Output: 12
    Explanation: The sum of the numbers between the 1st smallest number (3) and the 4th smallest 
    number (8) is 12 (5+7).
