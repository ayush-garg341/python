### Intro to async

- async.io stands for asynchronous input output and refers to a programming paradigm which achieves high concurrency using a single thread or event loop.
- The model is not novel to Python and is implemented in other languages and frameworks too.
- Folks with JavaScript background would find async.io very similar to how NodeJS works. NodeJS under the hood has a single-threaded event loop that serves all incoming requests.
